# unity-datasmith-import
Import models with textures into unity from a wide array of apps 

Installation

1. Move the scripts inside your Unity project  
2. Copy your model and its asset folder inside the Resources folder or one of its subfolders

I am working on increasing performance, reducing the size of the final models and supporting more materials properties and types.

If you want to decimate the mesh after importing use the decimation branch
