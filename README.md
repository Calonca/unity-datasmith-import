# unity-datasmith-import
Import models with textures into unity from a wide array of apps 

Installation

1. Move the scripts inside your Unity project  
2. Copy your model and its asset folder inside the Resources folder or one of its subfolders

I am working on increasing performance, reducing the size of the final models and supporting more materials properties and types.

This branch depends on [Unity Mesh Simpifier](https://github.com/Whinarn/UnityMeshSimplifier)<br>
If you don't want to decimate the mesh after importing use the main branch
